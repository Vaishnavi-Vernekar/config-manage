This project focuses on automating configuration management and deployment across multiple environments using IBM Cloud Container Registry, Docker, Kubernetes, and Jenkins, ensuring a seamless and scalable application delivery process without relying on Ansible. The solution leverages Docker to containerize applications, making them portable and consistent across different environments. IBM Cloud Container Registry serves as a secure repository for storing and managing container images, while Kubernetes orchestrates the deployment, scaling, and management of these containers efficiently. Jenkins is integrated as the CI/CD tool to automate the build, testing, and deployment pipeline, ensuring continuous integration and delivery. The overall goal is to streamline the deployment process, improve efficiency, reduce manual intervention, and maintain 

consistency across development, testing, staging, and production environments. By using cloud-native technologies, this project eliminates the need for traditional configuration management tools like Ansible, instead relying on Kubernetes-native mechanisms to handle configuration, scaling, and deployment.
